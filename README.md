# SteelHeart Bot

Goal - To create a Bot to handle most of SteelHearts Discord https://discord.gg/gmyKktH issues.  Keep it public so others can learn or borrow it for their own purposes.

1) To run the bot you will need to create a file called token.txt and add your discord bot token only to this file.  It must be stored in the same directory as the executable file.
